# Week 4: Where do all these reference sequences come from, anyway? (part 1)
Skills covered: contig assembly, scaffolding, assembly evaluation

## 7. Compare contig assembly results with the rest of class
Use the whole class data (shared on Slack) to make two scatter plots: k-mer size vs maximum contig length, and k-mer size vs contig N50 or longest k-mer. You can use anything you like to make the plots, and for k-mers where there are two different minimum abundance thresholds, just plot them as two separate points. In each plot, indicate which data points are yours.

If your k-mer size is not in the data already, add it before you make the plot. If you weren’t able to get
your QUAST results, that’s OK, this data will be in the output from the next step, and you can make
the full plot later.

Did k-mer size influence the success of the assembly? Answer in your lab report discussion.

Take a look at your quast results page. If you don’t have one, use the example results linked to in the spreadsheet. Click on the small link that says “Icarus: contig browser” near the top of the results, and use the browser to answer the IClicker question.
